## Backend Description

The application's backend is architected as a serverless solution on Amazon Web Services (AWS), primarily utilizing **AWS Lambda** functions developed with **Node.js**. These functions are typically exposed and managed via **Amazon API Gateway**, which handles API request routing, authorization, and other concerns.

Key backend functionalities include:

1.  **User Authentication:**
    *   The system integrates with Google OAuth for user sign-in.
    *   A custom Lambda authorizer, `google-jwt-authorizer.js`, is employed with API Gateway. This function is responsible for validating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) received from clients after they authenticate with Google, thereby securing the backend APIs.

2.  **Secure Credential Management:**
    *   The `get-aws-credentials.js` Lambda function plays a crucial role in security by generating temporary, time-limited AWS credentials.
    *   These credentials grant users (or the frontend acting on their behalf) secure, scoped-down access to AWS resources, most notably for direct and secure data uploads/downloads to Amazon S3.

3.  **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    *   The backend features a multi-step data processing pipeline, orchestrated to transform raw user data into meaningful insights.
    *   **Orchestration:** The `data-processing-orchestrator.js` Lambda acts as the central coordinator for this pipeline. It manages the flow of data and invokes other specialized Lambda functions in the correct sequence.
    *   **Processing Steps:**
        *   **Data Preprocessing:** (Implied, e.g., `data-preprocessor.js`) Raw data likely undergoes initial preprocessing, which can include cleaning, validation, and transformation to prepare it for subsequent stages.
        *   **Data Categorization:** (Implied, e.g., `categorize-user-data.js`) User data is then categorized. This step might involve sophisticated algorithms, potentially including machine learning or AI techniques, to classify and segment the data effectively.
        *   **Persona Building:** The `persona-builder.js` Lambda is a core component that takes the processed and categorized data to construct detailed user personas, which are a key output of the application.

This serverless backend design allows for scalability, cost-efficiency (pay-per-use), and maintainability, as each function handles a specific, well-defined task.
