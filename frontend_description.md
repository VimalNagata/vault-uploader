## Frontend Description

The application leverages a modern and lightweight frontend built using **React** and **TypeScript**. This combination allows for the development of a type-safe, component-based, and interactive user interface.

The primary roles of the frontend are:

1.  **User Interface (UI) Provision:** It serves as the main point of interaction for users, providing an intuitive and responsive experience.
2.  **Data Uploads:** The frontend includes functionality for users to upload their data to the application for processing. This likely involves forms and components designed for file handling.
3.  **Results Display:** After the backend processes the uploaded data, the frontend is responsible for presenting the results to the user. This could include displaying generated personas, categorized data, reports, or other insights derived from the data.
4.  **User Authentication:** The frontend facilitates user login and authentication, specifically integrating with **Google OAuth** to allow users to sign in securely with their Google accounts. This ensures that access to the application's features and data is controlled and personalized.

In essence, the React frontend acts as the face of the application, enabling seamless user interaction from data input and authentication to the visualization of processed outcomes.
