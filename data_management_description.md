## Data Management Strategy

The application employs **Amazon Simple Storage Service (AWS S3)** as its primary data storage solution, chosen for its scalability, durability, availability, and cost-effectiveness. This service is integral to storing user-uploaded data and potentially the outputs of the data processing pipeline.

Key aspects of the data management strategy include:

1.  **Primary Storage Service (AWS S3):**
    *   All persistent user data and application-generated data (like processed files or personas before they are potentially moved elsewhere) are stored in AWS S3 buckets.

2.  **Security and Access Control:**
    *   **Fine-Grained Access Control:** The system implements fine-grained access control for S3 objects. This ensures that data is protected and only accessible by authorized users or processes. This can be achieved through a combination of IAM roles, S3 bucket policies, and Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    *   **Temporary Credentials for Secure Access:** A critical security feature is the use of temporary, time-limited AWS credentials, generated by the `lambda/get-aws-credentials.js` function. This mechanism allows the frontend or other services to interact with S3 (e.g., for uploading files) directly but securely, without exposing long-lived credentials. These temporary credentials grant scoped-down permissions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

3.  **Data Organization and Isolation:**
    *   **User-Specific Folders:** To ensure data privacy and separation between different users, the application organizes data within S3 by utilizing user-specific folders (or prefixes). This means that each user's data is stored in a distinct location within the S3 bucket, preventing unauthorized access or accidental exposure of data between users. This approach also simplifies data retrieval and management on a per-user basis.

In summary, the data management strategy is built around AWS S3, emphasizing robust security through temporary credentials and fine-grained access policies, and clear organization through user-specific data segregation. This ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and efficient management.
